# forza-analyse
A desktop application that helps you analyse track performance in Forza Motorsport.

## What is it
A desktop motorsport data-analysis app for Forza. Lets you view race telemetry alongside a recording of your session and compare it with your fastest laps, or another session to help improve lap time.

## Analysis of Race Telemetry
Forza outputs live race telemetry through UDP packets sent either from the Xbox or the computer. The application receives and saves
this data to files on the computer and can display this data to you through graphs, alongside recordings of your race captured via screen capture or capture card.
